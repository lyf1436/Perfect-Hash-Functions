# Perfect-Hash-Functions

In this project, we finished the implementation of Minimal Perfect Hashing Function and
conducted the comparison between the naive version of Perfect Hashing Function from the
lecture. We also did some experiments to check the correctness of the algorithms involved.
This report mainly contains six parts: Introduction, Algorithm Implementation, Graph
Representation, Cycle detection, Test Unit, and Experimental Results and Comparison.
